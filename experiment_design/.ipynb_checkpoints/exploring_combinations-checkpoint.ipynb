    "# Exploring combinations\n",
    "In this experiment, we need to set up an interesting array of combinations of compounds. Each compound needs to be represented in triplicate on a plate, and it also needs to be present with 5 other compounds. The trick is, each replicate of each compound cannot be with the same compound more than once. For example, the set of compounds that are with `compound 1` would look like:  \n",
    "`[1,2,3,4,5] [1,6,7,8,9] [1,10,11,12,13]`  \n",
    "Likewise, the set for `compound 2` would then look like:  \n",
    "`[1,2,3,4,5] [2,6,10,14,15] [2,7,11,16,17]`  \n",
    "And `compound 3` would be:  \n",
    "`[1,2,3,4,5] [3,8,12,14,16] [3,9,13,15,17]`  \n",
    "So this gets pretty complicated pretty fast. The alogritim should basically be:\n",
    "- try to add the smallest number that\n",
    "    - isn't the number in question\n",
    "    - and hasn't already been added 3 times\n",
    "- if that fails, add the next largest number that we haven't used\n",
    "- and we want to know if this set is every complete"
